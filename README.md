# LaplaceValue_Generator

To prevent sensitive data disclosure, we use differential privacy. 
To achieve differential privacy, we add a noise from Laplace distribution to the correct query answer. 
Write code that generates Laplace noise.  
The Laplace distribution with scale β has density:
f(x) = 1/2β exp(-|x|/β)
